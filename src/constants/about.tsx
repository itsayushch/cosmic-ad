      Hello! Cosmic Advertising is a server that focuses on the growth of your
      server! And other social media you may want to share around in our
      channels. With the help of you, we can help grow this community to a
      larger advertisement server! You probably have a small server, ever wanted
      to fix that? All the methods you have tried don’t work. The five people
      who are on your server are rarely online. You have no money to spare and
      need to advertise. You’ve been banned from a lot of servers for DM
      advertising. Nothing is working. Come on down to Cosmic Advertising where
      we have 50 different channels fun self roles and an amazing loyal
      community!
